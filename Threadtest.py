This recipe describes how to handle asynchronous I/O in an environment
where you are running PyQt as the graphical user interface. PyQt is
safe to use as long as all the graphics commands are handled in a
single thread. Since it is more efficient to make I/O channels to
block and wait for something to happen rather than poll at regular
intervals, we want I/O to be handled in separate threads. These can
communicate in a threasafe way with the main, GUI-oriented process
through one or several queues. In this solution the GUI still has to
make a poll at a reasonable interval, to check if there is something
in the queue that needs processing. Other solutions are possible, but
they add a lot of complexity to the application.
